# Orpheus
Game developed at the 2017 Toronto Game Jam

## Description
This project is a combat game based around the music of the game. The player must use a beat bar indicator to land attacks to the rhythm of the music, failure to do so will result in not being able to complete stages. The back story to the game is made to fit the theme of the Game Jam, "prepare for disappointment."
